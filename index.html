            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            <p>This is an app available on iOS and Apple Watch, that helps you keep track of the last breast you fed your baby with when you're breastfeeding. The internet says it's good to alternate…</p>
            
            <h3>Wait… breasts?</h3>
            <p>Oh, right, let me explain — we just had our baby and we're breastfeeding. One Friday afternoon my partner asked if I could write an app for her watch so that she could keep track of the last boob she fed our baby with. So I did.</p>
            
            <h3>Oh… well, congrats on your baby!</h3>
            <p>Thank you — that's so nice of you to say! His name is Finn, and he's the most beautiful baby I've ever seen.</p>
            
            <h3>Why isn't this app free?</h3>
            <p>I've been making <a href="https://rafa.design" target="_blank">free apps for years now</a>, this one was especially challenging to write because I had a 2-week-old baby in the apartment with me, and I wrote the whole thing in a weekend. I feel like this could be helpful to other parents and the small amount that I'm charging would hopefully cover the costs of building it in the first place.</p>
            
            <h3>Ok cool…</h3>
            <p>Thanks so much for reading this and checking the app, even if it's not for you and you have no intention of purchasing it — I get it. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/rafahari" target="_blank">follow me on Twitter</a> if you'd like, a new follow always makes me smile.</p>
