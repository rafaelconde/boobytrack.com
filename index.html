            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            <p>This is an app for your Apple Watch, that helps you keep track of the last breast you fed your baby with, and the time of feeding.</p>
            
            <h3>Wait… breasts?</h3>
            <p>Oh, right, let me explain — we just had our baby and we're breastfeeding. One Friday afternoon my partner asked if I could write an app for her watch so that she could keep track of the last boob she fed our baby with. So I did.</p>
            
            <h3>Oh… well, congrats on your baby!</h3>
            <p>Thank you — that's so nice of you to say! His name is Finn, and he's the most beautiful baby I've ever seen.</p>
            
            <h3>Why isn't this app free?</h3>
            <p>I've been making <a href="https://rafa.design" target="_blank">free apps for years now</a>, this one was especially challenging to write because I had a 2-week-old baby in the apartment with me, and I wrote the whole thing in a weekend. I feel like this could be helpful to other parents and the small amount that I'm charging would hopefully cover the costs of building it in the first place.</p>
            
            <h3>Ok cool…</h3>
            <p>Thanks so much for reading this and checking the app, even if it's not for you and you have no intention of purchasing it — I get it. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/rafahari" target="_blank">follow me on Twitter</a> if you'd like, a new follow always makes me smile.</p>
